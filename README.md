# cse237-project

**Please see README.txt to view the progress report for iteration 3.**

**Class**: CSE237

**Group members**: Ian Youth | Jessica Wu | Jack Cho | Jaehwi Park

**Program Name**: Bear Banks

**Coding Language**: Java 

**IDE**: Eclipse

**Interface**: Text-based; command line application

**Overarching Project Summary**: "Bear Banks" will essentially be an ATM machine with which customers and employees can interact and execute various bank-related tasks. Our **target audience** would theoretically be (1) people who would like to bank with us, (2) people who work for Bear Banks, and (3) people who currently bank with us (3/29 note: additionally functionality to be added).

**Key Features**: Bear Banks will do anything that an ATM might normally do. The following is a working list of Bear Banks' capabilities:
    
    CUSTOMERS will eventually be able to do all of the following:
        1.) Open an account (everyone currently does this first)
        
        2.) Set credentials (Name; Pin number)
                        
        3.) View their account balance
        
        4.) Withdraw cash from their account
        
        5.) Deposit cash to their account
        
        6.) “Print” a receipt of their transaction history (after withdrawing/depositing cash)
                
        7.) View their account balance in terms of WashU meal points

        8.) View WashU-related apparel that they can buy with their current balance
        
    EMPLOYEES will eventually be able to do the following:
        1.) Lock the ATM for use
                        
        2.) Do anything that a customer might normally do (see above)
